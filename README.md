The provided code, expects two CSV files, which are exports of the feedbacks table, and the items table. 
These files however have not been uploaded to the repo, due to the sensitivity of the information that they 
contain, and because their data are considered avaible to the interested parties.
It should be noted that delivery of the contained code, was believed to be forbidden, due to the sensitive nature of
the provided data. 

The files contained, are mostly Jupyter Notebook files. The Python code they contain though, is expected to 
function appropriately in all environments, provided that the Pandas framework as well as the numpy library 
are available.
